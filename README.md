# Object-Detection

## Introduction
<p>Object Detection is used to scan digital images of real-life scenarios to locate instances of every object, separate them, and analyze their necessary features for real-time predictions.</p>

## Problem Definition
<p>Training a model that can identify objects from every day images can be used in several applications such as but not limited to;  pedestrian detection, animal detection, vehicle detection, people counting, face detection, text detection, pose detection, satellite imagery analysis, or number-plate recognition.</p>
